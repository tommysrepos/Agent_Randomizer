# Agent_Randomizer
Valorant agent randomizer changelog

Apr 04/23: Added inputs type = image each with a picture of one of the four valorant roles. Each input acts as a filter. When one filter is clicked, it will lower the opacity of all agents not in that role. All agents are given a class corresponding with their role.

Apr 01/23: Created array with all valorant agents.

Used math.floor(math.random) to randomly select one agent when "Choose My Agent!" button is clicked.

Added img of all agents currently available in the game.
